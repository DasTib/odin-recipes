    </p>
    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>12 slices bacon</li>

        <li>⅔ cup butter or margarine</li>

        <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>7 cups milk</li>

        <li>4 large baked potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>

        <li>4 green onions, chopped</li>

        <li>1 ¼ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>

        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally
            , until evenly browned, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; 
            crumble and set aside.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Gradually add 
            flour, whisking until well-combined. Slowly pour in milk, whisking constantly until
             smooth and thickened.</li>
        
        <li>Add potatoes and onions and bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Reduce heat and 
            simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
        
        <li>Stir in crumbled bacon, Cheddar cheese, sour cream, salt, and pepper. Continue 
            cooking and stirring until cheese is melted. </li>
